## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 20 or higher
- Rust toolchain (from rustup.rs)
- Platform-specific dependencies (see README.md)

   cd ktcedit
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install

3. Run in development mode:
   ```bash
   npm run tauri dev
   ```

4. Run type checking:
   ```bash
   npm run check
   ```

## Coding Standards

### TypeScript/Svelte

- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Follow existing code style
- Add type definitions for all functions and variables
- Use Svelte 5 runes API ($state, $derived, $effect)
- Avoid using `any` type

### Rust

- Follow Rust standard formatting (use `cargo fmt`)
- Add documentation comments for public functions
- Handle errors appropriately (use `Result<T, E>`)

### Commit Messages

### Code Review Process

1. All submissions require review
2. Reviewers will check:
   - Code quality and style
   - Test coverage
   - Documentation
   - Performance implications
3. Address review comments
4. Once approved, maintainers will merge

## Testing

### Manual Testing

Before submitting:
1. Test on your platform (macOS, Windows, or Linux)
2. Test with actual Kingdom Two Crowns save files
3. Verify backup creation works
4. Test all modified features

### Automated Testing

Currently, the project relies on:
- TypeScript type checking: `npm run check`
- Rust compilation: `cargo check` in `src-tauri/`

Future: Unit tests and integration tests are planned.

## Translation

To add a new language:

1. Edit `src/lib/i18n.ts`
2. Add your language to the `Language` type
3. Add translations to the `translations` object
4. Update `detectLanguage()` function to detect your language
5. Test all UI elements display correctly

Example:
```typescript
export type Language = 'en' | 'fr' | 'de'; // Added German

const translations: Record<Language, Translations> = {
  // ... existing translations
  de: {
    welcome: {
      title: 'Kingdom Two Crowns Speichereditor',
      // ... rest of translations
    }
  }
};
```

## Documentation

- Update README.md for user-facing changes
- Update BUILD.md for build process changes
- Add inline code comments for complex logic
- Update CHANGELOG.md following Keep a Changelog format

## Release Process

Releases are managed by maintainers:

1. Update CHANGELOG.md with all changes since last release
2. Update version in:
   - `package.json`
   - `src-tauri/Cargo.toml`
   - `src-tauri/tauri.conf.json`
3. Commit version bump:
   ```bash
   git commit -m "chore: bump version to v1.0.0"
   ```
4. Create and push tag:
   ```bash
   git tag v1.0.0
   git push origin v1.0.0
   ```
5. GitHub Actions builds and creates draft release
6. Review and publish release on GitHub
